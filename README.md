This is a repo for the Lightning Coalition Robotics website. Run index.html to see the website. It is currently setup with a bootstrap template we found online, if anyone finds a better template feel free to recommend it. From there we can edit the template to our liking.

Feel free to edit this repository in any way you see fit!
