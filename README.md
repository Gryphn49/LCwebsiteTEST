# LCRobotics-Website

This is a repo for the Lightning Coalition Robotics website. Run server.py, and go to localhost in your browser to see the website. It is currently setup with a bootstrap template I found online, if anyone finds a better template feel free to replace it. From there we can edit the template to our liking.
